# Ardunio
Worked on Ardunio 

I've worked with hardware and software using Arduino.
I used C++. I made simple projects such as displaying the temperature of the room on the 
LCD, parking sensor etc

What is Arduino?
Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software.
Arduino boards are able to read inputs - light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter message -
and turn it into an output - activating a motor, turning on an LED, publishing something online. You can 
tell your board what to do by sending a set of instructions 
to the microcontroller on the board. To do so you use the Arduino programming language (based on Wiring), 
and the Arduino Software (IDE), based on Processing.
